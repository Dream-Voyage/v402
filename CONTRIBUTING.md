- **Naming**: Use descriptive names, follow Python conventions

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Include integration tests where appropriate

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=v402_index_client --cov=v402_content_provider --cov=v402_facilitator

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_client.py
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for major changes
- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Update examples if APIs change
- Keep documentation in sync with code

- Log all important events
- Design for horizontal scalability
- Use database transactions appropriately

### Security

- Never commit private keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow security best practices for blockchain interactions
- Report security vulnerabilities privately

### Performance

- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Use async/await appropriately
- Optimize database queries
- Cache when beneficial
